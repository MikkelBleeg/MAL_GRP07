    "- Install a editor and set up the workspace.\n",
    "- Download data and load it into into the workspace.\n",

    "Split the data into test and train sets:\n",
    "- Test set:\n",
    "  - 20% of the dataset should be split into the test set. So that the we dont test the algorithm on the same data as the one we trained it with.\n",
    "  - If random sampling: Make sure that the data in test isn't loadet into the train set by using ```random.seed(42)``` and then ```np.random.permutation```  so that it is always the same random data that is saved in test.\n",

    "  - Closer to -1 is equal to a stronger negative corralation.\n",
    "  - Close to 0 equals no linear corralation.\n",
