    "### Resume: Look at the Big Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up the frame for the mashine learning project and building a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Background Research:\n",
    "- What is the end goal?\n",
    "- Which algorithms do we use?\n",
    "- Which preformance messures will be used to evaluate?\n",
    "- Do we already have a solution? if how should we improve it?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Framing the problem:\n",
    "Deside on Algorithms: \n",
    "- Supervised learning\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning\n",
    "- Reinforced learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deside on preformance messure:\n",
    "- RMSE (messuring standart deviation)\n",
    "- MAE\n",

    "\n",
    "### Resume: Get the Data (eksklusiv Create the Workspace og Download the Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Get data and create a workspace:\n",
    "- Install a editor and set up the workspace.\n",
    "- Download data and load it into into the workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Get a overview of the data:\n",
    "- What is the structure?\n",
    "- How many sampels?\n",
    "- How many and what are the Features (Atributes)?\n",
    "- Use diffrent meathods to create a overview:\n",
    "  - Use info() method to get quick information about the dataset.\n",
    "  - Use descripe() method to show a summary of the attributes.\n",
    "  - Use hist() to make a histogram over the dataset.\n",
    "    - What does the histogram tell about the data?  \n",
    "    - Look at the median.\n",
    "    - Look at the tails:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Split the data into test and train sets:\n",
    "- Test set:\n",
    "  - 20% of the dataset should be split into the test set. So that the we dont test the algorithm on the same data as the one we trained it with.\n",
    "  - If random sampling: Make sure that the data in test isn't loadet into the train set by using ```random.seed(42)``` and then ```np.random.permutation```  so that it is always the same random data that is saved in test.\n",
    "  - Stratified sampling: the data is devided into hogenis subgrupes caled strata. \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"The_Map_2.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resume: Discover and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights,\n",
    "More in depth work with the data, and ensure that the test set has been put aside.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Visualizing the data:\n",
    "- Create a scatterplot of the data.\n",
    "  - Collor the data or viasualice the density in the data in another way. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Correlations:\n",
    "- Standart corralation (Linear corralation)\n",
    "  - Ranges from -1 to 1:\n",
    "  - Closer to 1 is equal to a strons positive coralation.\n",
    "  - Closer to -1 is equal to a stronger negative corralation.\n",
    "  - Close to 0 equals no linear corralation.\n",
    "- Look at other corralations:\n",
    "  - Pandas ```scatter_matrix``` function.\n",
    "  - Corraltaion Scatter plot.\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Try diffrent attrivute combinations:\n",
    "- Plot the diffrent sttributes together maybe based on at pattern seen in the previouslet ccorraltions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resume: Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms\n",
    "##### Create functions to prepare the data for mashine learning algorithms because:\n",
    "- You can recreate the transformationa and use the transformations on other datasets.\n",
    "- You build a libary of transformation functins to reduce future ML projects.\n",
    "- Use them in the ML system to transform data and feed to the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Clean the data:\n",
    "- If there is missing features the algorithm cannot work with the data so this needs to be cleaned up.\n",
    "- dropna()\n",
    "- drop()\n",
    "- filna() to be uses after finding the median with .median() on the data. It fills out the missing value in the trainingset.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Fit and train the data with you functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Handling text and cartegorical attributes:\n",
    "Transformers called encoders. Because Mashine Learning algorithms work with numers and cannot wotk with labels or categories we need to transform these into numerical values, and we can do this with encoders:\n",
    "- LabelEncoder()\n",
    "- One-Hot encoding, which is a binarry encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Custom transformers:\n",
    "Transformers that fits the dataset that is worked on that transform the data into data tat can be feed to the ML algorithms. these can consist of cleanup function and or functions that combines different attributes. In the transformers one can also play with combining and working on different hyper parametres.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Feature Scaling\n",
    "The attributes that we want the ML algorithm often needs to be the same scale which is why feature scaling sometimes is needet. \n",
    "\n",
    "two commom ways to scale attributes to the same scale is:\n",
    "- min-max scaling.\n",
    "- standatdization.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Transforming pipelines:\n",
    "All estimatores except for the last needs to be a transformer and must have a \n",
    "```fit_transform()``` meathod the last estimator only needs the ```fit()``` \n",
    "method. \n",
    "\n",
    "This way one can make a pipeline of the transformers with the output of one trandformer feeding data to be inputted in the next transformer. \n",
