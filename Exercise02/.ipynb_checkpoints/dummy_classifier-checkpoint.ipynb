In the first tree tests we expect the predict to return true as we can see from the print of y_test that they should have the resulting value 5, and the fourth test have a diffrent value than 5. As we can see the first test returns false and second and third test returns true. The fourth test returnes false which is what we expected. Therefore we can se that our simple fit predict isn't perfect, which is why we look at the cross validation score to expect the preformance of our model.\n",
